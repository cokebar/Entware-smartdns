# Entware-smartdns
This is a fork of https://github.com/Entware/entware-packages/tree/master/net/smartdns

Entware official package is not the latest version of smartdns

So this repo is developed to follow the latest commit of smartdns (https://github.com/Entware/entware-packages/tree/master/net/smartdns).

You can build from source following the instruction: https://github.com/Entware/Entware/wiki/Compile-packages-from-sources
